## General Introduction

A **smart city** is an urban area that uses different types of electronic data collection sensors to supply information which is used to manage assets and resources efficiently.

One of the biggest problems of nowadays large cities is the necessary mobility of its residents. As you can observe very well these days, the constant flow of traffic causes many problems. One of these problems is the resulting increased environmental pollution (aggravated by traffic jams) and its impact on the health of the people and animals living there.

The time that people are wasting, due to this traffic situation is also having a negative impact on their life quality.
That's why a smart city needs a highly efficient traffic control system to bring a large number of people to their desired destination quickly and with low emissions.

In my opinion, this can only succeed if the traffic control system can monitor any type of transportation and is able to manage the traffic control elements (e.g. traffic lights).
Thus, an constant distribution of all available resources can be achieved and the emerging traffic can be minimized.
Among other things, this system will have to be based on the existing model of carsharing, because with growing cities the available space will be more and  more limited and for example there will not be enough space left, so that every citizen can have their own car-slot in front of his house/flat or in a parking garage next to his  work.
But instead of having an own car, the citizen of the future is having access to a large number of means of transportation, which will consists out of available buses, cars, subways or bicycles.

A centralized schedule (control unit) ensures that everyone comes to the place they want to be, without wasting unnecessary resources (such as time) or making compromises (eg available space).

## Requirements (Experimental Design)

For better clarity of the planning process, imagine the following everyday situation:

A citizen has to get to work at 9 a.m., leaving the work at 5 p.m., picking up his 2 kids from the lacrosse training at 6 p.m. and must get back home (including the lacrosse-equipment).
The evening before, each appointment has to be registered in the digital calendar, so that the central traffic control unit can create a preliminary plan based on the submitted plans of all citizens.
When the person is waking up, he would receive an message, that it curently would be faster to take the rental-bike to the subway station (the weather is also good and the health app recommends a little bit of exercise;) ) to reach his workplace on time. Everything worked like it was planned.
When he is leaving the work at 5:15 p.m. the central unit has to reschedule the plan and offers a bus ride to the school. During these rush hours, the traffic lights are switched by the control unit in the way so that traffic can flow optimally. Our person is arriving at the school at 5:55 p.m. and a reserved car (that is big enough for 3 persons and the equipment) is waiting next to the school, so that they can get easily back home.



(remove: You should start by specifying a set of requirements. I specified a topic Smart Cities but what exactly does that mean-  you should practice formulating your own set of requirements and an experiment. Define a hypothesis of a problem cities face and how a smart city would possibly help alleviate this issue. This helps you think about your problem communication and system objectives inputs, functions, and outputs - they should be clearly specified.)

## Smart City (My Problem) Model

(remove: add a high-level overview of your model, the part below should link to the model directory markdown files)
(remove: Look at the [**Object Diagram**](model/object_diagram.md) for how to structure this part of Part 2 for each diagram. Only the Object diagram has the template, the rest are blank. )

* [**Object Diagram**](model/object_diagram.md) - provides the high level overview of components
* [**Class Diagram**](model/class_diagram.md) - provides details of (what are you providing details of)
* [**Behavior Diagram**](model/behavior_diagram.md) - provides details of (what are you providing details of)
* [**Agent / User case** (if appropriate)](model/agent_usecase_diagram.md) - provides details of (what are you providing details of)

## Smart City (My Problem) Simulation

(remove: for part 3 add two to three sentences here and link the [**(your own name)**](model/README.md) file in the analysis folder - which describe how you would simulate this - type of simulation, rough details -inputs, outputs - how it will help you analyze your experimental hypothesis, or nullify your null hypothesis.)
