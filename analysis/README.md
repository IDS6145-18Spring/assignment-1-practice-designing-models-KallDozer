## Smart City "Traffic Control Unit" Simulation

For the simulation of my traffic planning application I would choose the approach of a discrete event simulation, because the overall system is mainly consisting out of management commands that are based upon an previous created schedule.
This is an optimized plan in which the needs of the citizens for mobility are realized, with simultaneous minimum expenditure of means of transport.

For this reason, I think that no continuous simulation is needed, because it is sufficient to calculate the individual processes step by step. 

In order to accomplish this task, the system has control over any traffic control elements and can associate the existing means of transport with the requests.



(remove: Roughly, how would you conduct the simulation to produce the results from your specification?)
